Code H10.  did npm i and  npm install dotenv.  if this does not help then I will refactor code into clean files.

![screenshot](./public/img/error1Heroku.png)

Reloade .env npm to no avial.  it says its lodaded but cannot get past node.  I deleted and re-entered ""start": "node server.js".  did a clean start/ rewrote connections file.

### Heroku Failure:

Not changing things, minor refactor.  checked locally.
